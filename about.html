                <p>E.B. Morrison writes MM romance stories full of love, connection, and the kind of messy, tender moments that make us feel human. With a background that’s taken him through the worlds of banking, civil engineering, and tech, E.B. draws from real-life twists and turns to create characters that feel honest, layered, and deeply relatable.</p>

                <p>After years in technical work that never quite scratched the creative itch, he found his way to storytelling—specifically MM romance, where vulnerability meets strength and love comes in many forms. His stories focus on character-driven relationships, emotional depth, and that feeling of finding home in another person.</p>

                <p>When he’s not writing, E.B. is usually diving into a new programming project, hiking local trails with Max, his energetic Australian Shepherd, or curling up with a good romance novel. A longtime daydreamer, he believes deeply in the power of fiction to reflect who we are and who we want to be.</p>

                <p>E.B. lives with his husband, Anthony, and their loyal (and opinionated) canine writing assistant, finding inspiration in quiet moments, unexpected adventures, and the beautiful mess of everyday life.</p>

            <h3>what I write</h3>
            <p>I write stories with emotional depth, layered characters, and the kind of tender, slow-burn romance that sticks with you. I’m especially drawn to exploring love, identity, and the quiet moments that shape who we are. My goal is to create realistic relationships, complex characters, and the kinds of stories I’ve often struggled to find—stories that reflect the real, messy, beautiful experiences within the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

            <h3>current projects</h3>
            <p>I’m currently working on my debut MM romance novel, set in a working-class small town where a rugged, no-nonsense country boy finds himself unexpectedly drawn to someone softer, sweeter, and unlike anyone he's ever known. It’s a story about connection across differences, the tension between pride and vulnerability, and learning to love without apology. This emotionally rich, character-driven romance explores identity, masculinity, and the power of being truly seen—and truly wanted.
